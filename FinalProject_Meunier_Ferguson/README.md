# BenchBot
Repository for EC500 D1 final project to automate steps in the cloning process.  This is a user friendly GUI that will allow reasearchers to easily interface with the DoBot to aid in tedious lab work.

  1. PyQt5
  2. QT Creator 5.6
  3. Python 3.5
  4. PyOpenGL 3.0
    1. This must be installed from the source because GLUT is necessary for rendering the 3D cubes in the GUI.  Installed from source ensures the user will have this OpenGL package. More documentation can be found on this here: http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/documentation/installation.html
  5. A program to upload the .ino arduino files to the arduino. Standard one available here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
